        <ol>
            <li>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).
                <p> My name is Bianca and I'm a Communication Design junior.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.
                <p> I'm a design major who is interested in illustration. This is one of my major requirements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.
                <p>In Type I last semester, we did a short workshop on HTML and formatted an article for a screen.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.
                <p>I'm looking forward to exploring how my design skills will adapt to a format I don't have much experience with. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.
                <p>When I design for paper, I sometimes feel that my work is fixed and can't be changed after submitting the "final" version. I expect designing for the screen to be more flexible because you can make big changes with a small line of code. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.
                <p> I've seen a lot of <a href="https://www.graza.co">Graza</a> products in store and I really like how the product design aligns with the website design. The interactive elements are fun and I'm a fan of the color palette. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.
                <p>The <a href=https://www.zillow.com>Zillow</a> website is great at displaying all the necessary information for a customer to browse, search, and filter through homes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice
                <p>I think the <a href=https://www.youtube.com>YouTube</a> website works well because everything is visually clear and not overwhelming. I like how you can get a preview of a video by hovering over it with your mouse. </p>
